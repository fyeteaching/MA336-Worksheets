\subsection{Experiments, Sample Spaces, and
Events}\label{experiments-sample-spaces-and-events}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  An \textbf{experiment} is a procedure that can be infinitely repeated
  and has a well-defined set of outcomes.
\item
  An \textbf{outcome} is the result of a single trial (individual
  repetition) of an experiment.
\item
  A \textbf{chance experiment} (or \textbf{random experiment}) is an
  experiment that has more than one possible outcome and whose outcomes
  cannot be predicted with certainty.
\item
  The \textbf{sample space} of a chance experiment is the set of all
  possible outcomes.
\item
  An \textbf{event} is a subset of the sample space.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}
A classic example of chance experiment is to toss a fair coin. The following figure shows observed outcomes from an experiment of tossing a coin 100 times as well as the true probabilities of getting a head and a tail.\\ (See \url{https://seeing-theory.brown.edu})

\hypertarget{complement-intersection-and-union}{%
\subsection{Complement, Intersection and
Union}\label{complement-intersection-and-union}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{complement} \(E^c\) of event \(E\) is the set of all
  outcomes in a sample space that are \textbf{NOT} included in event
  \(E\).
\item
  The \textbf{intersection} \(A\cap B\) of two events \(A\) and \(B\) is
  the set of all outcomes in the sample space that are shared by \(A\)
  and \(B\).
\item
  The \textbf{union} \(A\cup B\) of two events \(A\) and \(B\) is the
  set of all outcomes in the sample space that are either in \(A\) or
  \(B\).
\item
  Two events \(A\) and \(B\) are \textbf{mutually exclusive} if there
  intersection \(A\cap B\) is empty.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{classical-definition-of-probability}{%
\subsection{Classical Definition of
Probability}\label{classical-definition-of-probability}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A \textbf{probability} \(P(E)\) is the measures of how likely an
  outcome in the event \(E\) will occur in a chance experiment.
\item
  \textbf{Equally likely} means that each outcome of an experiment
  occurs with equal chance.
\item
  When the outcomes in the sample space of an chance experiment are
  \textbf{\emph{equally likely}}, the probability of an event \(E\) is
  \[P(E)=\dfrac{\text{number of outcomes in }E}{\text{number of outcomes in }S}\]
\item
  Chance experiment that involves tossing fair coins, rolling fair dice
  and drawing a card from a well-mixed deck of cards have equally likely
  outcomes.
\item
  Note that many chance experiment do not have equally likely outcomes.
  For example, the majors of students in a class are not equally likely
  outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}

Imagine flipping one fair coin (which means the chance of a head and the
chance of a tail are the same). What is the probability of getting the
head.

\end{example}
\vspace*{5\baselineskip}

\hypertarget{empirical-probability}{%
\subsection{Empirical Probability}\label{empirical-probability}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  An \textbf{empirical (or a statistical) probability} is the relative
  frequency of occurrence of outcomes from observations in repeated
  experiments:
\end{itemize}

\[
\begin{aligned}
  P(E)=&\dfrac{\text{number of occurrence of event } E}{\text{total number of observations}}\\[0.5em]
  =&\dfrac{\text{frequency in }E}{\text{total frequency}}.
\end{aligned}
\]

\begin{example}

A statistics class has 5 math majors and 20 other majors. If a students
was randomly select from the class, what's the probability that the
selected students is a math major?

\end{example}
\vspace*{4\baselineskip}

\begin{exercise}

  A group of people were asked if they had run a red light in the last year. 332 responded "yes", and 164 responded "no".

  Find the probability that if a person is chosen at random, they have run a red light in the last year.

\end{exercise}

\hypertarget{theoretical-probability}{%
\subsection{Theoretical Probability}\label{theoretical-probability}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Theoretical probability is an expected value that can be calculated by
  mathematical theory and assumptions.
\item
  When all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely, the
  probability of a desired event \(E\), known as a \textbf{theoretical
  probability}, is calculated by

  \[
  P(E)=\dfrac{\text{number of desired outcomes for event }E}{\text{number of all possible outcomes}}.
  \]
\item
  \textbf{Tree diagrams} are often used for counting all possible
  outcomes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}

Find the probability of getting two heads when flipping a fair coins
twice.

\end{example}

\begin{exercise}

  Flipping a fair coin twice, find the probabilities of getting exactly
  one head.

\hypertarget{law-of-large-numbers}{%
\subsection{Law of Large Numbers}\label{law-of-large-numbers}}

\textbf{Law of Large Numbers:} As an experiment is repeated over and
over, that is the number of trials getting larger and larger, the
empirical probability of an event approaches the theoretical
probability of the event.
(\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers}{Wiki: Law
of large numbers}.)

By the law of large number, we can say that the probability of any
event is the \textbf{long-term relative frequency} of that event.

\begin{example}

The following figure shows the probability of simulating coin flipping 1000 times.

\hypertarget{fundamental-properties-that-define-probability}{%
\subsection{Fundamental Properties (that Define
Probability)}\label{fundamental-properties-that-define-probability}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Property 1:} For an event \(E\), the probability \(P(E)\) is
  ranged from 0 to 1: \[0\leq P(E)\leq 1.\]
\item
  \textbf{Property 2:} If \(S\) is the sample space, then \(P(S)=1\).
\item
  \textbf{Property 3:} The probability of an event
  \(E=\{e_1,e_2, \cdots e_k\}\) of distinct outcome is equal to the sum
  of probabilities of individual outcomes:
  \[P(E)=P(e_1)+P(e_2)+\cdots+P(e_k)\] where \(P(e_i)\) is the
  probability of getting the outcome \(e_i\).
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}

When an event \(E\) consists of infinitely many outcomes, the right hand
side of the equality in Property 3 will be an infinite sum.

\end{remark}


\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Easy consequence 1:} If events \(A\) and \(B\) are mutually
  exclusive, then \[P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B).\]
\item
  \textbf{Easy consequence 2:} The probability \(P(E)\) of an event
  \(E\) and the probability \(P(E^c)\) of the complement event \(E^c\)
  satisfies the identity: \[P(E)+P(E^c)=1.\]

  Equivalently, \[
  P(E^c)=1-P(E)\quad\text{or}\quad P(E)=1-P(E^c).
  \]
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}

A six-sided fair die is rolled. Denote by \(E\) the event of getting a
number less than \(3\).

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Find the probability \(P(E)\) of the event \(E\).
\item
  Find the probability \(P(E^c)\) of the complement \(E^c\) of the event
  \(E\).
\item
  Verify that \(P(E)+P(E^c)=1\).
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\begin{example}

Two six-sided fair dice were rolled. Find the probability of getting two
numbers whose sum is at least 4.

  \item an orange?
\end{enumerate}
  
\end{exercise}

\hypertarget{the-addition-rule}{%
\subsection{The Addition Rule}\label{the-addition-rule}}

When outcomes in the sample spaces are equally likely,

\begin{itemize}
\item
  the \textbf{probability of the intersection} of two events is \[
  P(A\cap B)=\dfrac{\text{numbers of elements in } A\cap B}{\text{number of elements in the sample space }S}.
  \]
\item
  the \textbf{probability of the union} of two events is \[
  P(A\cup B)=\dfrac{\text{numbers of elements in } A\cup B}{\text{number of elements in the sample space }S}.
  \]
\end{itemize}

In general, the probability of the union of two events from a chance
experiment is defined by the basic rules and the addition rule.


\textbf{Addition Rule:} the probability of the union of two events
\(A\) and \(B\) is \[
P(A\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A\cap B).
\]

\begin{example}
  A card was randomly drew from a deck of 52 cards.

\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

\hypertarget{the-conditional-probability}{%
\subsection{The Conditional
Probability}\label{the-conditional-probability}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The \textbf{conditional probability} of \(A\) given \(B\), written as
  \(P(A\mid B)\), is the probability that event \(A\) will occur given
  that the event \(B\) has already occurred.
\item
  In the case that the chance experiment has equally likely outcomes,
  the conditional probability is, \[
  P(A\mid B)=\dfrac{\text{numbers of elements in }A\cap B}{\text{number of elements in }B}.
  \]
\item
  In general, we may use fundamental rules of probability and the
  multiplication rule to calculate the conditional probability.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}

A fair die is rolled.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
  Find the probability that the number rolled is a five, given that it is odd.
  \item
  Find the probability that the number rolled is odd, given that it is a five.
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\hypertarget{the-multiplication-rule}{%
\subsection{The Multiplication Rule}\label{the-multiplication-rule}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Multiplication Rule:} the probability of the intersection of
  two events \(A\) and \(B\) satisfies the following equality \[
  P(A\cap B)=P(B)P(A\mid B)=P(A)P(B\mid A).
  \]
\item
  The multiplication rule gives a formula for conditional probability:
  \[
  P(B\mid A)=\dfrac{P(A\cap B)}{P(A)}\qquad\qquad P(A\mid B)=\dfrac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.
  \]
\end{itemize}


\begin{example}

  Consider flipping a fair coin and rolling a fair six-sided die together.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    What's the probability that the coin shows a head?
  \item
    Given that a head occurs, what's the probability that the die shows a
    number bigger than 4?
  \item
    What's the probability of getting a head and a number bigger than 4?
  \item
    Verify that flipping a head and rolling a number bigger than 4 are
    independent events.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  \end{example}

\hypertarget{independent-events}{%
\subsection{Independent Events}\label{independent-events}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Two events \(A\) and \(B\) are \textbf{independent} if \[
  P(A\mid B)=P(A)\quad \text{ or }
  \quad P(B)=P(B\mid A).
  \] Equivalently, \[
  P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B).
  \]
\item
  \textbf{Fundamental Counting Principle:} if there are \(m\) ways of
  doing something and \(n\) ways of doing another thing independently,
  then there are \(m\cdot n\) ways of performing both actions \emph{in
  order}.
\end{itemize}



\begin{example}

The probability that a student borrows a statistics book from the
library is 0.3. The probability that a student borrows a biology book is
0.4. Given that a student borrowed a biology book, the probability that
he/she borrows a statistics book is 0.6.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Find the probability that a student borrows a statistics book and a
  biology book.
\item
  Find the probability that a student barrows a statistics boor or a
  biology book.
\end{enumerate}

\end{example}

\hypertarget{sampling-with-replacement-or-without-replacement}{%
\subsection{Sampling with Replacement or without
Replacement}\label{sampling-with-replacement-or-without-replacement}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{With replacement:} If each member of a population is replaced
  after it is picked, then that member has the possibility of being
  chosen more than once. When sampling is done with replacement, then
  events are considered to be independent, meaning the result of the
  first pick will not change the probabilities for the second pick.
\item
  \textbf{Without replacement:} When sampling is done without
  replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once. In
  this case, the probabilities for the second pick are affected by the
  result of the first pick. The events are considered to be dependent.
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}

Two cards were randomly drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards
\emph{with replacement}. Find the probability of getting exactly one
club card.
