\subsection{The Basic Idea of Hypothesis
Testing}\label{the-basic-idea-of-hypothesis-testing}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The testing procedure starts with an initial assumption that the
  statement on population parameter is true.
\item
  We test this initial assumption using a random sample. If the initial
  assumption is really the truth, then the test statistic from a random
  sample shouldn't be too far away from the center of the sampling
  distribution. Conversely, if the test statistic is too far
  away from the center, then we should not believe in the
  initial assumption.
\item
  To determine how far is too far away, we need to specify a threshold,
  a prior probability, or equivalently a critical value.
\item
  If the test statistic is at least extreme as the critical value, then
  the testing is significant enough to allow us to reject the initial
  assumption. Otherwise, we cannot draw a definite conclusion.
\item
  The prior probability measures the chance that the initial assumption
  was wrongly rejected.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{two-hypotheses}{%
\subsection{Two Hypotheses}\label{two-hypotheses}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A statistical \textbf{hypothesis} is a statement about a population
  parameter.
\item
  A \textbf{hypothesis test} is a process that uses sample statistics to
  test a \textbf{hypothesis}.
\item
  To test a population parameter, we choose a pair of hypotheses, the
  null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis which are contradictory
  to each other.
\item
  The \textbf{null hypothesis}, denoted by \(H_0\), is the statement
  about the population parameter that is assumed to be true.
\item
  The \textbf{alternative hypothesis}, denoted \(H_a\), is a statement
  about the population parameter that is contradictory to the null
  hypothesis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Logic of Hypothesis
Testing}\label{the-logic-of-hypothesis-testing}}

The logic of hypothesis testing and two types of error can be summarized in the following table.

\begin{fullwidth}
  \colorbox{white}{
\parbox{\linewidth}{\centering
  \begin{tabular}{l|*{2}{l}}
    ACTION & $H_0$  is Actually True & $H_0$  is Actually False\\
    \midrule

    Reject  $H_0$ &	Type I Error & Correct Outcome
  \end{tabular}
}
  }
\end{fullwidth}


The interpretation of hypothesis testing is summarized in the following
table.

\begin{fullwidth}
  \colorbox{white}{
\parbox{\linewidth}{\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|p{0.35\linewidth}p{0.35\linewidth}}
  Action & If the claim to be tested is in \(H_0\) & If the claim to be tested is in \(H_a\) \\
  \midrule
  Reject \(H_0\) & There is enough evidence to reject the claim
  & There is enough evidence to support the claim \\
  Fail to Reject \(H_0\) & There is not enough evidence to reject the claim & There is not enough evidence to support the claim

\hypertarget{type-of-errors-in-hypothesis-testing}{%
\subsection{Type of Errors in Hypothesis
Testing}\label{type-of-errors-in-hypothesis-testing}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is indeed true is called a
  \textbf{type I error}. The maximum allowable probability of making a
  type I error is called the \textbf{level of significance}, denoted by
  \(\alpha\). In other words,
  \[\alpha=P(\text{Type I error})= P(\text{reject a true }H_0).\]
\item
  Failing to reject the null hypothesis when the it is false is called a
  \textbf{type II error}. The probability of a type II error is usually
  denoted by \(\beta\). The \textbf{power of a hypothesis test}, equals
  \(1-\beta\), is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when
  it is false.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{type-of-tests}{%
\subsection{Type of Tests}\label{type-of-tests}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If \(H_a\) has the form \(\mu\neq \mu_0\) the test is called a
  \textbf{two-tailed test}.
\item
  If \(H_a\) has the form \(\mu<\mu_0\) the test is called a
  \textbf{left-tailed test}.
\item
  If \(H_a\) has the form \(\mu>\mu_0\) the test is called a
  \textbf{right-tailed test}.
\item
  Each of the last two forms is also called a \textbf{one-tailed test}.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{observed-significance}{%
\subsection{Observed Significance}\label{observed-significance}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  To make a decision, one may also compare probabilities. The
  \textbf{observed significance} (\textbf{$P$-value}) of a test statistic is the probability of obtaining a sample statistic at least as extreme as the (observed) test statistic, given that the null hypothesis were true.
\item
  \(P\)-Value as Tail area

  \(P\)-value & Double of the tail area & Left tail area \\
  \bottomrule()
  \end{longtable}
\item
  Making decision by comparing the \(P\)-value with the significance
  level \(\alpha\):

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    reject \(H_0\) if \(p\le \alpha\)
  \item
    fail to reject \(H_0\) if \(p>\alpha\).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{example}

Given the following testing hypotheses

\(H_{0}: p=0.50\) vs.~\(H_{a}: p\ne 0.50, n=360, \hat{p}=0.56\),

find the \(P\)-value for the test and make a decision at the 5\% level
of significance.

\end{example}
\vspace*{8\baselineskip}

\begin{example}

It is believed that a stock price for a particular company will grow at
a rate of \$5 per week with a standard deviation of \$1. An investor
believes the stock won't grow as quickly. The changes in stock price is
recorded for ten weeks and are as follows: \$4, \$3, \$2, \$3, \$1, \$7,
\$2, \$1, \$1, \$2. State the null and alternative hypotheses, find the
p-value, and identify the Type I and Type II errors.

\hypertarget{hypothesis-testing-procedure}{%
\subsection{Hypothesis Testing
Procedure}\label{hypothesis-testing-procedure}}

\begin{enumerate}[sepno]
\item
  Check if the population distribution is approximately normal or sample size is large enough and determine if a \(Z\)-test
  or \(T\)-test can be performed. For proportion, \(Z\)-test may be
  used. For mean, if \(\sigma\) is known, the \(Z\)-test may be used. If
  \(\sigma\) is unknown, the \(T\)-test may be used.
\item
  State the null and alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis always
  contains the equal sign (and possibly together with a less than or
  greater than symbol, depending on \(H_a\).)
\item
  Set a significance level \(\alpha\). Commonly used levels are
  \(\alpha=0.01\), \(\alpha=0.05\) and \(\alpha=0.1\).
\item
  Calculate the standardized test statistic: the \(Z\)-test statistic or
  the \(T\)-test statistic.
\item
  Calculate the \(P\)-value according to the type of the test.

  \begin{tabular}{cc}
    \toprule
    Sign in \(H_a\) & Type of Test\\
    \midrule
    \(\ne\) & Two-tailed\\
    \(<\) &  Left-tailed\\
    \(>\) & Right-tailed\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  
\item
  Make a test decision about the null hypothesis \(H_0\). We reject
  \(H_0\) if the \(P\)-value less than the significance level
  \(\alpha\).
\item
  State an overall conclusion.
\end{enumerate}
\vspace*{-0.5\baselineskip}

\begin{example}

Residences on a certain street claim that the mean speed of automobiles
run through the street is greater than the speed limit of 25 miles per
hour. A random sample of 100 automobiles has a mean speed of 26 miles
per hour. Assume the population standard deviation is 4 miles per hour.
Is there enough evidence to support the claim of the residences at the
significance level \(\alpha = 0.05\)?

\end{example}
\vspace*{8\baselineskip}

\begin{example}

A certain manufacturer claims that average numbers of candies in a
certain sized bag that they produce is 20. To test the claims, you
collected a random sample of 10 bags and find the mean is 18 and the
standard deviation is 2.7. Assume the numbers of candies are normally
distributed. At the significance level \(\alpha=0.05\), does your
analysis support the manufacturer's claim?

\end{example}

\begin{example}

An instructor would like to know if the students enrolled in a math
course in the current semester performed better than students in the
last semester. The mean final exam from last semester is 75.5. The final
exam scores of 40 randomly selected 40 students were obtained

\begin{fullwidth}

Do the data provide evidence that the students in this semester
performed significantly better on the final than last semester?

\begin{example}

Suppose you want to determine if a coin is fair. You toss the coin 50
times and observe 16 heads and 34 tails. At the significant level 0.01,
do you think that the coin is fair? If not, does the coin favor the head
or tail?

\end{example}
\vspace*{8\baselineskip}

\begin{example}

Globally the long-term proportion of newborns who are male is 51.46\%. A
researcher believes that the proportion of boys at birth changes under
severe economic conditions. To test this belief randomly selected birth
records of 5,000 babies born during a period of economic recession were
examined. It was found in the sample that 52.55\% of the newborns were
boys. Determine whether there is sufficient evidence, at the 10\% level
of significance, to support the researcher's belief.

\end{example}
\vspace*{8\baselineskip}

\begin{remark}

In some books, the standard error of the sample distribution of sample
proportions assuming that \(p=p_0\) is calculated using the
approximation \[
\sigma_{\hat{p}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}.
\]

An arguable explanation is that using the above value for SE will be
consistent with the approach to a hypothesis testing using a confidence
interval in the case that a two-tailed test is preformed.

\end{remark}

\begin{example}

  The mean work week for engineers in a start-up company is believed to be
  about 60 hours. A newly hired engineer hopes that it's shorter. She asks
  ten engineering friends in start-ups for the lengths of their mean work
  weeks. Based on the results that follow, should she count on the mean
  work week to be shorter than 60 hours?
  
  Data (length of mean work week): 70; 45; 55; 60; 65; 55; 55; 60; 50; 55.

\begin{exercise}

Decide whether the following statements are true or false. Explain your reasoning.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In case of a left-tailed test, we reject the null hypothesis if the
  sample statistic is significantly smaller than the hypothesized
  population parameter.
\item
  A \(P\)-value of 0.08 is more evidence against the null hypothesis
  than a \(P\)-value of 0.04.
\item
  The statement, ``the \(P\)-value is 0.03'', is equivalent to the
  statement, ``there is a 3\% probability that the null hypothesis is
  true''.
\item
  Even though you rejected the null hypothesis, it may still be true.
\item
  Failing to reject null hypothesis means the null hypothesis is true.
\item
  That the \(P\)-value of a sample statistic is \(p=0\) means the null
  hypothesis cannot be true.
